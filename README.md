# Digital Wallet Hub 🌐💰

Welcome to the E-Wallet Application repository! This full-stack application seamlessly combines the power of Spring Tool Suite (STS), Angular 9, and a backend database (H2) to provide a robust and user-friendly digital wallet experience.

## Technologies Used 🚀

- **Spring Tool Suite (STS):** The backend of the application is built using STS, a powerful and developer-friendly integrated development environment (IDE) for building Spring-based enterprise applications.

- **Angular 9:** The frontend is developed using Angular 9, a dynamic and versatile framework that enables the creation of modern and responsive user interfaces.

- **Backend Database (H2):** The application currently utilizes H2 as the backend database. However, there are plans to transition to Oracle 11g, enhancing scalability and data management capabilities.
